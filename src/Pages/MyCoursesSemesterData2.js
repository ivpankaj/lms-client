                        content: `**Understanding Website Hosting & Domain:** Website hosting and domain registration are fundamental components of establishing an online presence. Hosting refers to the service that stores and serves your website's files, while a domain is the web address where users can access your site. Both play crucial roles in ensuring your website is accessible and functional on the internet.
                    
                        **Choosing the Right Hosting Provider:** Selecting a reliable hosting provider is essential for your website's performance and security. Different types of hosting include shared, VPS (Virtual Private Server), dedicated, and cloud hosting. Consider factors like uptime guarantees, customer support, scalability, and performance when choosing a provider.
                    
                        **Registering a Domain Name:** A domain name is your website's online address. Registering a domain involves selecting a unique name and purchasing it from a domain registrar. It's important to choose a domain name that reflects your brand and is easy for users to remember. Domains are typically registered for a period of one year and can be renewed as needed.
                    
                        **Managing Domain Settings and DNS:** Once you have a domain, you need to manage its settings and DNS (Domain Name System) records. This includes configuring settings such as domain forwarding, email setup, and connecting your domain to your hosting provider. Proper domain management ensures your website and associated services function correctly.`,
